# Hello!

Welcome to my blog! It took me a while to ~~copy~~ I mean write code to adapt it to my website!

So you might say "Oh that's cool but What will be in this blog?".

Well, to start things out I'm probably going to put a lot of different topics. These include but are not limited to:

- Rants
- Devlog
- Guides (If i can't seem to find a similar one.)

This does not include political opinions. But I'm still going to needlessly rant about big tech annoying the crap out of me :D

_Hopefully_ my website doesn't crash and burn in flames. One of the things I like about this blogpost (and Svelte in general) is that it **does not** require JS.
So any JS freak can stop crying about "Libre" or "Anti" JS stuff. This should _also_ avoid that situation where archive websites get to scrape the frontend but never the backend
and we end up with a forever lost and broken archive.

Finally, [the source code for the website is in my github repo, if you're interested.](https://github.com/midou36o/midou36o.github.io) (go to the svelte-stable branch!)

Generally _everything_ is working, minus the dark mode for some parts that you might not notice actually, but I'll figure that out once I feel like hating myself even further, speaking of which, why is JS such a pain to use?

There will be no comments section on my blog. But my email and other accounts are open to discuss with me!

**PS:** If someone knows how to write a proper RSS feed that takes the blogpost into a compatible feed, please send a PR or teach me how!!
