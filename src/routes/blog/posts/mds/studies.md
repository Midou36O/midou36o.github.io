A few days ago I went to a class with an amazing professor who managed to teach something extremely hard to grasp for the first time very easily.
I thought he was already a professor with a doctorate, yet at the end, he said he also was a student, and that the real professor was just here to supervise and help him in some cases.
That student said he loved this subject, he loved talking about this domain and could go on and on... The passion to this subject somehow made him capable of teaching the subject in a nice manner.

Then I remembered that a few weeks ago, a student told me how computer science sucks and is impossible to grasp. Now to his defense our professor wasn't good at teaching something.
Either he would assume that everyone already knew about the subject, or just pulled the text-to-speech move (as in reading the presentation out loud with no added value to it.). But _I_ didn't find this
true and told the student that it was an amazing domain to dive in.

But then I realised that _I_ had been studying computer science ever since I was 6 years old, my first time using a computer was when I was 4,
I was already capable of going to youtube and google at that time, believe it or not. I learnt everything on my own, experimented with code, even developed a philosophy
when writing code, the meaning of using computers and writing software. The computer science area is very vast, you want to specialize in graphics ? You can do that. You
want to delve deep into the sound engineering ? You can also do that. You want to know the inner workings of a proprietary software you wish was open? _You_, **can** do that.

And as such you could consider computer science a playground, your own playground to test and experiment with things, see what it does, just like in physics and chemistry.
But you see... I don't like physics, and I _hate_ chemistry. I don't see any fun in them, and I always got bad grades in those subjects. Because the professors that tried to
"teach" me couldn't do it properly, or did in a way I couldn't understand and asking for clarification would just get you a roast from your professor for not paying attention.
I would be lost trying to understand what I'm even doing in the subject, and just as I start to finally grasp what Is happening in class ? It's already too late, the exam passed,
the grades show up. And I get a bad grade, but I finally understand the subject. _But it's too late_. A second try doesn't guarantee better results, as a matter of fact, I had sleepless
nights, studying, memorizing, and doing everything to get a perfect score, and yet I receive a slightly better grade, but it is still not enough to be considered a pass, worse, the professor
wouldn't even consider giving you the minimal grade to be able to compensate with other subjects' extra good grades (here it's 10+).

At this point I knew that any passionate person would teach better than a professor with a doctorate (Go figure out how this country manage to get doctorates, with how many
of them are incompetent or careless), A grade is more affected by the professors' emotional and motivation state more than any of your efforts. And a lot of students suggest me
to move to another country to study there with more fair professors. But if I'm being honest ? I don't think the situation would improve wherever you go, unless you're rich and able
to afford a special professor that will focus solely on you to teach you every subject needed. You won't get anything ...

That doesn't mean you should give up, I mean if I give up I'm pretty much done for, and the society expects you to have a job, earn money, and start the adults' life. You can't just
live in isolation, it's impossible, but the luck factor is still there even in studies, you could be lucky and _not study at all_ and be rich, as much as you can be very unlucky and study
really hard until you become an engineer (or any high status paying job) only to still be unemployed for years and forced to do some random cheap job just to survive. The world is cruel,
but you can't just give up on it.

My point is, in the end, the important part of studying isn't grades or diplomas (I mean they are but it's more of a luck factor as I said), It's the subjects themselves, have you learnt something
new ? Use it ! Theories and tons of theories won't get you anywhere unless you use them. Do something you love, and apply what you learnt in life, don't just memorize it for the grades and
forget it after, otherwise you're just making yourself think you're here for the grades only and will feel bad when you don't quite reach that goal.

I don't think I have anything else to say so... If you have some remarks or any clarifications, let me know by sending me a mail or contacting me through the links of the landing page. See ya!
